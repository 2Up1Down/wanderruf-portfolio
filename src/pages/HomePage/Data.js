  description: `Hi there, thanks for your visit on my website.
   
  My name is Wendelin Steiner and I enjoy hiking, nature, photography and drones. So why not combine altogether? This and the current Covid situation \u{1F605} was the birth of the idea behind Wanderruf (German word for "call to wander"). 
  The idea to explore Switzerland, to capture the beauty of the nature and to share it. 
  I would be delighted if my pictures and videos serve as inspiration for your next adventure.
  
  Don't hesitate to contact me for a collaboration or with suggestions for places worth exploring.
